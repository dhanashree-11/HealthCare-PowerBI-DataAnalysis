# Hospital Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
During  one-month training phase at Edunet, I developed a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI to analyze hospital data. The project involved several key steps:
- Data collection
- Data importation
- Preprocessing
- Applying DAX functions
- Designing a dashboard for data visualization

This project was developed just for the purpose of getting familiar with tools in Power BI, and it was fun working on it as a beginner.

### Here is the preview of the Dashboard
